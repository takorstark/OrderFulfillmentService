It is a servive

## What is Order Fulfillment ?
* Order fulfillment is the complete process from point of sales inquiry to delivery of a product to the customer. Sometimes Order Fulfillment is used to simply describe the act of distribution (logistics) or the shipping function, but in the broader sense it refers to the way firms respond to customer orders, and the process they take to move products from those orders, to the customer.
* In simpler terms, Order Fulfillment is everything that a seller does from the moment an order for a product is received, to the customer having their purchase in their hands. Order Fulfillment also includes the processes involved in receiving products to sell, storing those products, and providing inventory control of those products.
